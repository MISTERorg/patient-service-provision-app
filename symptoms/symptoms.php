        <div class="s-df">Pain is the most common symptom of disease. It is an unpleasant sensation localized to a part of the body. It is often described in terms of a penetrating or tissue-destructive process (e.g., stabbing, burning, twisting, tearing, squeezing) and/or of a bodily or emotional reaction (e.g., terrifying, nauseating, sickening). Any pain of moderate or higher intensity is accompanied by anxiety and the urge to escape or terminate the feeling.</div>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <div class="s-dg"> Self-report is the key to pain assessment. In non- or pre verbal children, facial expression is the most valid indicator of pain; therefore use faces pain scale to assess severity. Pain should be assessed by: <br> <br>  <br><br>- Duration <br><br>- Severity, e.g. does the patient wake up because of the pain <br><br>- Site <br><br>- Character, e.g. stabbing, throbbing, crushing, cramp like <br><br>- Persistent or intermittent <br><br>- Relieving or aggravating factors <br><br>- Accompanying symptoms <br><br>- Distribution of pain <br><br>- In children pain can be assessed by childs’ crying voice, posture, movement and colour.  </div>

    <td>Primary headache </td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Primary headaches include migraine, tension, and cluster headaches, as well as a variety of other less common types of headache 
 
 Migraine Headache This is characterized by a trial of paroxysmal headache, vomiting and focal neurological events (usually visual). It is more common in females than in males often there is a family history of migraine. Associated precipitants include: <br> <br>- <br> Dietary (cheese, chocolate or red wine) <br> Psychological stress 
  
 General Measures <br> Avoidance of precipitants <br> Relaxation to reduce stress 
  
 Medicines In acute attack give analgesics: <br> <br> <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Paracetamol 1g immediately then every 4 hours; Max 4g per day  OR <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Aspirin 600mg, repeat after 4 hours if needed.  Plus <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Metroclopramide oral/IM, 10 mg 3 times daily. In severe attack give: <br> <br> <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Ergotamine tartrate 1-2 mg, maximum 4mg in 24hours, not to be repeated at intervals less than 4 days. For prevention purposes give: <br> <br>  <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Propranolol 80-160mg daily  OR  <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Amitryptiline 10-50mg at night. Referral <br> Patient with additional neurological signs or additional risk factors for an alternate diagnosis, such as immune deficiency. These patients require brain imaging <br> Sudden onset of a first severe headache  may indicate serious organic pathology, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage <br> Acute migraine, not responding to treatment <br> Recurrent migraine not controlled with prophylactic therapy 
  
  
 Tension headaches While tension headaches are the most frequently occurring type of headache, the cause is most likely contraction of the muscles that cover the skull. When the muscles covering the skull are stressed, they may spasm and cause pain. Common sites include the base of the skull, the 
  
 temple and the forehead. Tension headaches occur because of physical or emotional stress placed on the body. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> The pain begins in the back of the head and upper neck and is described as a band-like tightness or pressure.  <br> Often is described as pressure encircling the head with the most intense pressure over the eyebrows.  <br> The pain usually is mild (not disabling) and bilateral (affecting both sides of the head).  <br> The pain is not associated with an aura (see below), nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound.  <br> The pain occurs sporadically (infrequently and without a pattern) but can occur frequently and even daily in some people.  <br> The pain allows most people to function normally, despite the headache. 
  
<b> Note: <br> <br></b><br> <br> The key to making the diagnosis of any headache is the history given by the patient <br> If the health care practitioner finds an abnormality, then the diagnosis of tension headache would not be considered until the potential for other types of headaches have been investigated. 
  
 Treatment Tension headaches are painful, and patients may be upset that the diagnosis is "only" a tension headache. Even though it is not life-threatening, a tension headache can affect the activities of daily life. The following work well for most people: <br> <br> <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Aspirin (300-900mg (O) every 4-6 hrs max 4g daily)  OR <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Ibuprofen (1.2-1.8g daily in 3-4 divided doses preferably after food max dose 2.4g daily, maintenance dose of 0.6-1.2g daily may be adequate.) OR <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Paracetamol 1g (O) 8hrly   OR <br><b>D: <br> <br></b> Naproxen 0.5-1g in 1-2 divided daily doses  Massage, and stress management can all be used as adjuncts to tension headaches.  
 <br> When pain medications are used for a prolonged period of time, headaches can recur as the effects of the medication wear off. Thus, the headache becomes a symptom of the withdrawal of medication (rebound headache). 
  
 Cluster headaches Cluster headaches are headaches that come in groups (clusters) lasting weeks or months, separated by pain-free periods of months or years. The cause of cluster headaches is uncertain. Some evidence shows that brain scans performed on patients who are in the midst of a cluster headache, shows abnormal activity in the hypothalamus. Cluster headaches: <br> <br> <br> May tend to run in families and this suggests that there may be a genetic role <br> May be triggered by changes in sleep patterns <br> May be triggered by medications (for example, nitroglycerin) 
  
 If an individual is in a susceptible period for cluster headache, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and some foods (for example, chocolate) also can be potential causes for headache. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> Pain typically occurs once or twice daily and last for 30 to 90 minutes  <br> Attacks tend to occur at about the same time every day  <br> The pain typically is excruciating and located around or behind one eye. The affected eye may become red, inflamed, and watery 
  
<b> Note: <br> <br></b><br>  Cluster headaches are much more common in men than women. 
  
 Treatment 
 <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Sumatriptan 6mg; Dose may be repeated after 1 hour. Max dose 12mg a day 
 OR  
   <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> 100% Oxygen at the rate of 10-15L/min for 10-20 minutes 
 Prevention of the next cluster headache may include the following: <br> <br>   <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Verapamil 240-960mg (O) 8 -12 hourly divided doses OR <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Amitryptiline 25-50 mg (O) daily 
  
 Prevention cluster headaches Since cluster headache episodes may be spaced years apart, and since the first headache of a new cluster episode can't be predicted, daily medication may not be warranted. 
 Lifestyle changes may help minimize the risk of a cluster headache flare. Stopping smoking and minimizing alcohol may prevent future episodes of cluster headache. </div>

    <td>DEHYDRATION</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">It is defined as the excessive loss of body fluid. There are three types of dehydration: <br> <br> hypotonic or hyponatremic (primarily a loss of electrolytes, sodium in particular), hypertonic or hypernatremic (primarily a loss of water), and isotonic or isonatremic (equal loss of water and electrolytes). In humans, the most commonly seen type of dehydration by far is isotonic (isonatraemic) dehydration which effectively equates with Hypovolemic, but the distinction of isotonic from hypotonic or hypertonic dehydration may be important when treating people who become dehydrated. Physiologically, dehydration, despite the name, does not simply mean loss of water, as water and solutes (mainly sodium) are usually lost in roughly equal quantities to how they exist in blood plasma. In hypotonic dehydration, intravascular water shifts to the extra vascular space, exaggerating intravascular volume depletion for a given amount of total body water loss. Neurological complications can occur in hypotonic and hypertonic states. The former can lead to seizures, while the latter can lead to osmotic cerebral edema upon rapid rehydration.  
 
 Hypovolemic Hypovolemic is specifically a decrease in volume of blood plasma. It defines water deficiency only in terms of volume rather than specifically water. 
 Signs and symptoms Symptoms may include headaches similar to what is experienced during a hangover, a sudden episode of visual snow, and dizziness or fainting when standing up due to orthostatic hypotension. Untreated dehydration generally results in delirium, unconsciousness, swelling of the tongue and, in extreme cases, death. 
 Thirst, dryness of mucous membrane, loss of skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia, reduced jugular venous pressure (JVP) or central venous pressure (CVP) and decreased urine output. In the presence of normal renal function dehydration is associated usually with a urine output of less than 0.5ml kg/hr. 
 Differential diagnosis 
  
 In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair water homeostasis in the body. These include: <br> <br> 
 <br> External or stress-related causes  o Prolonged physical activity with sweating without consuming adequate water, especially in a hot and/or dry environment o Prolonged exposure to dry air, e.g., in high-flying airplanes (5%–12% relative humidity) o Blood loss or hypotension due to physical trauma o Diarrhea o Hyperthermia o Shock (hypovolemic) o Vomiting o Burns o Lacrimation o Use of methamphetamine, amphetamine, caffeine and other stimulants o Excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages 
 <br> Infectious diseases (Refer to gastrointestinal chapter for details) o Cholera o Gastroenteritis o Shigellosis o Yellow fever 
 <br> Malnutrition o Electrolyte disturbance o Hypernatremia (also caused by dehydration) o Hyponatremia, especially from restricted salt diets o Fasting o Recent rapid weight loss may reflect progressive depletion of fluid volume (the loss of 1 L of fluid results in a weight loss of 1 kg (2.2 lb)).  o Patient refusal of nutrition and hydration o Inability to swallow (obstruction of the esophagus) 
 Other causes of obligate water loss 
 <br> Severe hyperglycemia, especially in diabetes mellitus o Glycosuria o Uremia <br> Diabetes insipidus <br> Acute emergency dehydration event <br> Food borne illness 
 Tests include: <br> <br> 
 <br> Blood chemistries (to check electrolytes, especially sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels) <br> Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
  
 <br> Complete blood count (CBC) <br> Creatinine <br> Urine specific gravity 
 Other tests may be done to determine the cause of the dehydration (for example, blood sugar level to check for diabetes). 
 Treatment 
 For some dehydration oral fluid is the most effective to replenish fluid deficit. 
 In more severe cases, correction of fluid deficit is best by intravenous therapy. Solutions used for intravenous rehydration must be isotonic or hypotonic. 
 For severe cases of dehydration where fainting, unconsciousness, or other severely inhibiting symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status.  </div>

    <div class="s-df">Hypoglycemia is a condition of lower than normal level of blood glucose.  
Criteria referred to as Whipple's triad are used to determine a diagnosis of hypoglycemi<b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b>  
1. Symptoms known to be caused by hypoglycemia 2. Low glucose at the time the symptoms occur 3. Reversal or improvement of symptoms or problems when the glucose is restored to normal 
Symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until the blood sugar is in the level of 2.8 to 3.0 mmol/L (50 to 54 mg/dl). The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on (1) the measurement method, (2) the age of the person, (3) presence or absence of effects, and (4) the purpose of the definition. 
Signs and symptoms Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counter regulatory hormones (epinephrine/adrenaline and glucagon) triggered by the falling glucose, and the neuroglycopenic effects produced by the reduced brain sugar. 
 
 Adrenergic manifestations 
<br> Shakiness, anxiety, nervousness <br> Palpitations, tachycardia <br> Sweating, feeling of warmth (although sweat glands have muscarinic receptors, thus "adrenergic manifestations" is not entirely accurate) <br> Pallor, coldness, clamminess <br> Dilated pupils (mydriasis) 
 
<br> Feeling of numbness "pins and needles" (paresthesia) 
Glucagon manifestations <br> Hunger, borborygmus <br> Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort <br> Headache 
Neuroglycopenic manifestations <br> Abnormal mentation, impaired judgment <br> Personality change, emotional liability <br> Fatigue, weakness, apathy, lethargy, daydreaming, sleep <br> Confusion, amnesia, dizziness, delirium <br> Stupor, coma, abnormal breathing <br> Generalized or focal seizures 
Causes 
The circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances include the age of the patient, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or "diary" of the spells over several months, noting the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the hypoglycemia. 
Glucose requirements above 10 mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6 mg/kg/minute in children and adults are strong evidence for hyperinsulinism. In this context this is referred to as the glucose infusion rate (GIR). 
Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than 30 mg/dl (1.70mmol/l) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia. 
For patients who have recurrent hypoglycemia’s the following tests might be needed depending on the history and physical examination: <br> <br> insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children.  
Treatment Management of hypoglycemia involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. 
The blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking 10-20 grams of carbohydrate. It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 100-120 ml of orange juice or non-diet soda. Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking acarbose), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full 
 
recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards. 
If unconscious or for other reasons can not feed orally secure an IV line and give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can be very necrotic if the IV is infiltrated. If an IV cannot be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an intramuscular injection. 
One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharide’s that can be absorbed by the body, patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose powder, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.

    <td>ORAL AND DENTAL CONDITION </td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Oral disease conditions are common and range from dental caries, periodontal conditions, dental abscess and other acute bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, traumatic injuries and tumors. The lesions affecting the maxillofacial region (perioral, jaws and face) are also considered here but for a more detail a relevant text book or manual need to be referred. The clinician should be able tqo identify conditions requiring immediate attention by the dentist, do the preliminary urgent and life saving measures where possible before referring the patient to a centre with a dentist/dental surgeon. There are some cases which will need the attention of a specialist dental surgeon (like oral and maxillofacial surgeon, orthodontist e.t.c) but in most cases these will be identified by a general dentist. 
 PERIODONTAL CONDITIONS 
 Gingivitis Inflammatory changes in the gingival develop within a couple of days of undisturbed bacterial growth on the cervical portion of the tooth surface. 
 
Diagnostic criteri<b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> <br> Inflammation of the gingival which is initially seen as discrete colour and texture changes of the marginal tissues. <br> After few days of plaque accumulation  overt gingivitis is established, characterized by gingival redness and swelling and increased tendency of the gingival to bleed on gentle probing, during tooth brushing or even on touch. 
 
Prevention Instructions for proper oral hygiene care 
 
Treatment Removal of accumulated plaque and oral hygiene instructions on tooth brushing and other adjuvant means of oral hygiene (dental flossing, use of mouth washes) 
 Periodontitis This is the progression of the inflammation of gingivitis into the deep tissue affecting the periodontal membrane causing periodontal pockets, introduction of infection and destruction of periodontium. The damage of the periodontal membrane, periodontal ligaments and eventually alveolar bone leads to formation of pockets which eventually favours more bacterial growth. As the destruction continues the teeth become loose and may eventually fall out. 
 
Diagnostic Criteria <br> Reddened, swollen gingiva <br> Easily bleeding gingival on gently probing <br> Loose/mobile teeth <br> Bad breath from the mouth 
 
<br> Gingival recession <br> Periodontal pocket 
 
Investigation : <br> <br> Mainly X-ray (orthopantomogram (OPG)) to determine extent of bone loss 
 
Prevention and Non Pharmacological Treatment <br> Instruction and guidance to the patients on proper oral hygiene for proper plaque control <br> Plaque control by the dentists by scaling and root planning (this may need several visits as may be found necessary) <br> Advanced treatment – if refractory/resistant to treatment or patient has systemic diseases conditions. 
 
Note: <br> <br> Patients with systemic diseases conditions like diabetes mellitus, liver and renal diseases, HIV/AIDS and those who are pregnant or heavy smokers of cigarette are generally at increased risk of periodontal diseases and their management may need referral to a periodontal specialist 
 
Pharmacological treatment <br> Mouth washes: <br> <br> <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Hydrogen peroxide 3% 3-4 times daily OR <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% 3-4 times daily OR <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Povidone iodine 0.5% used 3-4 times daily will argument the plaque control treatment. Use antibiotics only for severe cases and those with evidence of periodontal abscess formation: <br> <br> <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Metronidazole (O) 400mg 8 hourly for 5 days Plus <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Amoxicillin 500 mg 8 hourly for 5 days OR <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Tetracycline 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days. 
 
1.3 Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG) It is a severe form of gingivitis and it characterized by rapid destruction of gingival tissue, particularly in the area of the interdental papilla.  Patients usually present with soreness and bleeding of the gums and foul test (fetor-ex ore). Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG) is also called Vincent’s gingivitis or Vincent’s gingivostomatitis. It is common in malnourished children and immunocompromized individuals especially patients with diabetes and HIV/AIDS. 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: <br> <br> Tetracycline should not be given to pregnant and lactating mothers to avoid tetracycline stains in for their babies. 
 
Diagnostic criteria <br> Painful and easily bleeding gingival swelling and erythema of the gingival margins <br> Yellowish-white ulceration of the gingival <br> Fever, malaise and regional lymphadenitis <br> In some patients (especially malnourished children), ANUG may presents with extensive destruction of the face and jaws in the severe form known as Cancrum Oris or noma 
 
Treatment <br> Professional cleaning with Hydrogen Peroxide 3% (under local anesthesia) 
<b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Metronidazole 400 mg (O) 8 hourly a day for five days 
Plus 
<b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Amoxicillin 500mg (O) 6 hourly for 5 days 
 
1.4 Stomatitis This is generalized inflammation of the oral mucosal (including the gingiva) due to different aetiologies. Such aetiologies include infections, chemical burn, radiations. Contact stomatitis (a counterpart of contact dermatitis) also can occur due to allergy. 
Diagnosis 
Oral sores and ulceration 
Treatment 
Generally supportive <br> Mouth rinse

    <td>DENTAL CARIES</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">It is a condition whereby the tooth is demineralized by acid which is produced by bacteria in the process of metabolizing sugar. Start slowly with white spots later developing to black/brown spot and cavities in enamel, dentine and eventually the pulp. Dental caries is caused by bacteria of the dental plaque which feed on sugary food substrates producing acid as by-products which dissolve the minerals of the tooth surface.  The bacteria which cause dental caries are mainly of streptococcus ( S.mutans , S. viridians ) 
Diagnostic Criteria <br> Early stage – asymptomatic <br> Intermediate stage: <br> <br>- black/brown spot which may be visible on any surface of tooth <br> Cavities developing on tooth surface <br> Pain/toothache elicited by hot, cold or sweet foods/drinks <br> Late stage: <br> <br> pain may be spontaneous, intermittent, sharp and severe, even interfering with sleep. <br> There is tenderness on percussion of the tooth. 
<br> X-Rays: <br> <br> Periapical x-ray of tooth/teeth may need to be done especially to confirm extent of caries for treatment decision e.g. the caries contained in the dentine can be distinguished from pulpal caries. 
Note: <br> <br> The Susceptible sites are those areas where plaque accumulation can occur and be hidden to escape active and passive cleansing mechanisms e.g. pits and fissures of the posterior teeth, interproximal surfaces and teeth in malocclusion. 
Prevention 
<br> Proper instruction to avoid frequent use of sugary foods and drinks 
<br> Use fluoridated toothpaste to brush teeth at least once a day 
Non-pharmacological measures 
<br> Early lesions presenting as a spot on enamel without cavitation and softening, observe and adhering to preventive measures. 
<br> Lesion with cavitation but confined to dentine – filling/restoration of teeth with suitable filling materials (e.g. amalgam, composite, glass ionomer) 
<br> Lesion involving the pulp (with or without periapical abscess), perform advanced tooth restoration by endodontic treatment wherever possible otherwise tooth extraction is done.

Note: <br> <br> For this condition and other life threatening oral conditions consultation of available specialists (especially oral and maxillofacial surgeons) should go parallel with life saving measures. 
3.6 Pericoronitis Inflammation of the soft tissues covering the crown of erupting tooth and occurs more commonly in association with the mandibular third molar (wisdom) teeth. Impaction of food and plaque under the gingiva flap provide a medium for bacterial multiplication. Biting on the gum flap by opposing tooth causes laceration of the flap, increasing the infection and swelling. Then more likelihood of traumatic biting, this may lead to a vicious cycle. Involved bacteria are similar to those causing gingivitis and periodontitis. 
 
Diagnosis <br> High temperature, <br> Severe malaise <br> Discomfort in swallowing and chewing <br> Well localized dull pain, swollen and tender gum flap <br> Signs of partial tooth eruption or uneruption in the region <br> Pus discharge beneath the flap may or may not be observed <br> Foetor-ox oris bad smell <br> Trismus <br> Regional lymphnodes enlargement and tender

<br> Excision of the operculum/flap (flapectomy) is done under local anesthesia 
<br> Extraction of the third molar associated with the condition 
<br> Other means include: <br> <br> Grinding or extraction of the opposing tooth 
<br> Use analgesics <br> Consider use antibiotics especially when there are features infection like painful mouth opening and trismus, swelling, lymphadenopathy and fever. 
 
Drug of choice <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Amoxicillin 500mg (O) 6 hourly for 5 days Plus <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Metronidazole 400 mg (O) 8 hourly for 5 days 
 
If severe (rarely) refer section  3.4 on treatment of dental abscess 
3.7 Osteomyelitis of the Jaw It is an inflammation of the medullary portion of the jaw bone which extends to involve the periosteum of the affected area. The infection becomes established in the bone ending up with pus formation in the medullary cavity or beneath the periosteum obstructs the blood supply.  The infected bone becomes necrotic following ischemia. 
 
Diagnosis <br> In the initial stage there is no swelling. The patient has malaise and fever 
<br> There is enlargement of regional lymphnodes. 
<br> The teeth in the affected area become painful and loose, thus causing difficulty in chewing. 
<br> Later as the bone undergoes necrosis the area becomes very painful and swollen. 
<br> Pus ruptures through the periosteum into the muscular and subcutaneous fascia. 
<br> Eventually it is discharged on to the skin surface through a sinus. 
 
Investigation : <br> <br> X-ray – OPG (Orthopantomograph ) or mandibular lateral oblique, water’s view for maxilla/midface. The x-ray will show sequestra formation in chronic stage. In early stage features seen in x-ray include widening of periodontal spaces, changes in bone trabeculation and areas of radioluscency. Perform culture and sensitivity of the pus to detect the specific bacteria. 
 
Treatment Non-pharmacological <br> Incision and adequate drainage to confirmed pus accumulation which is accessible <br> Culture should be taken to determine the sensitivity of the causative organisms 
 
<br> Removal of the sequestrum is by surgical intervention (sequestrectomy) is done after the formation of sequestrum has been confirmed by X-ray. 
 
Pharmacological <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Amoxicillin or cloxacillin 500mg 6 hourly Plus <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Metronidazole 400mg gram 8 hourly before getting the culture and sensitivity then change according to results. 
 
For details on antibiotics see section  3.4 <br> Antibiotic therapy may be continued for about 1-3 months. <br> Referral is recommended to a zonal referral hospital for any case with long standing pus discharge and sinuses from the jaws

 Diagnosis There are 3 types of alphthous ulcers 
  
 Minor alphthous ulcers  <br> Small round or ovoid ulcers 2-4 mm in diameter.  <br> Surrounded by an erythematous halo and some edema <br> Occur in groups of only a few ulcers (i.e., 1-6) at a time <br> Found mainly on the non keratinized mobile mucosa of the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, sulci, or ventrum of the tongue <br> Heal spontaneously in 7-10 days.  <br> Leave little or no evidence of scarring 
 Major Alphthous ulcers  Painful ulcers on non-keratinized oral mucous membrane, they are large 1-3 cm edged ulcers, and several may be present simultaneously.   There is marked tissue destruction which is sometimes constantly present.  Healing is prolonged often with scarring 
  
 Herpetiform ulcers These occur in a group of multiple ulcers which are small (1-5 mm) and heal within 7-10 days Rationale of treatment: <br> <br> To offer symptomatic treatment for pain, and discomfort, especially when ulcers are causing problems with eating 
  

  
 Treatment 
 <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Prednisolone 20 mg tid for 3 days then dose tapered to 10 mg tid for 2 days then 5 mg tid for other 2 days.

 Primary bleeding socket <br> Active bleeding from the socket  <br> The socket may or may not have blood clot   <br> Patient may be dehydrated and pale if has lost significant amount of blood <br> Features of decreased pulse rate and volume, hypotension also if has lost significant amount of blood <br> Examine well the socket may be having traumatic area of surrounding bone of the socket 
  
 Secondary bleeding socket may show features of infection or trauma 
  
 Treatment Guidelines <br> After quick survey make sure the patient airway, breathing and circulation are restored if there were derangements <br> Check Blood pressure and pulse rate and take quick history <br> Give Local anesthesia (lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1 in 80,000 IU)  <br> Clear any clot available and examine the socket to identify source of bleeding <br> If the bleeding was from soft tissue (which is common) remove any foreign body like bone spicule if found, smoothen any sharp edges  <br> Suturing of the wound only when necessary (like significantly traumatize gingiva)  <br> Check and repack the socket with gauze.  <br> Give proper instructions to follow (bite on gauze pack for 30 minutes, not to rinse or eat hot foods on that day at least of 12 hours and avoid disturbance to the wound) Packing can be done by material which stimulate blood clotting like oxidized cellulose (e.g. surgicel/gauze) or Thrombin containing gel foam sponges

Symptoms associated with it like fever and diarrhea are normal and self limiting unless any other causes can be established.  The following conditions usually are associated with tooth eruption and should be referred to dental personnel: <br> <br> eruption cysts, gingival cysts of the newborn and pre/natal teeth. <b> NOTE: <br> <br></b><br> There is nothing like “nylon teeth” what is a myth/believe existing in some traditions instead there are various above mentioned conditions associated with eruption of deciduous/primary teeth 
9.2 Shedding of Deciduous/Primary (Milk) Teeth Phenomenon of loosing of deciduous/primary teeth occurring between aged of 5-12 years is normal physiological changes.  Deciduous/primary teeth should be left to fall out on themselves unless the teeth are carious or there is any other indication.  Parents should be counseled accordingly and be instructed to assist their children to loosen the teeth the already mobile teeth and when there is no success or the permanent teeth are erupting in wrong direction should consult a dentist.  Most of carious teeth will need management by a dentist. Early loss of primary teeth may lead to crowding of permanent teeth. 
 
9.3 Edentulousness It is the partial or full loss of natural teeth and subsequent resorption of the alveolar bone.   
 
 
Treatment: <br> <br>   It is by designing and constructing dental prosthesis according to aesthetic and functional needs.  Materials to be used are many and include: <br> <br> alginate impression materials, calcium chloride powered, acrylic and porcelain, (refer NEMLIT for dental supplies) </div>

    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Malocclusion is any variation in the arrangement of teeth leading to abnormal occlusion to the extent that may be functionally harmful or aesthetically objectionable.    
 
 Diagnosis There are several forms of malocclusion  
  
 Class 1 The sagittal arch relationship is normal.  The anterior buccal groove of the lower permanent molar should occlude with the anterior buccal cusp of the upper first permanent molar. Class II The lower arch is at least one half a cusp widths too far distal to the upper. Class III The lower arch is at least one half a cusp widths too far mesial to the upper. 
  
 Treatment  Rationale for treatment: <br> <br>  <br> Reduce possibility of temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome especially in case of cross bites <br> Reduce risks of traumatic dental injuries especially in overjet <br> Traumatic occlusion and gum diseases and caries especially in crowing  <br> Avoid psychosocial effects resulting from to lack of self esteem, self confidence personal outlook and sociocultural acceptability   
  
 Removable orthodontic appliances are those designed to be removed by the patient then replaced back.  They are very useful in our local settings especially for mild to moderate malocclusion in teenagers. 
  
 Appliances for active tooth movement fall into two groups <br> Simple removable appliances which have mechanical a component to move the teeth <br> Myofuctional appliances, which harness the forces generated by the orofacial muscles. 
  
 Passive removable appliances may also save two functions: <br> <br> <br> Retainers used to hold the teeth following active tooth movement <br> Space maintainers, used to prevent space loss following the extraction of teeth. 
  
 Fixed orthodontic appliances (braces) are useful in malocclusion which have resulted in relapses of failure after use of removable appliances and moderate to severe malocclusion which can not be managed by removable appliances especially adult patients. Adolescents and adult patients requiring fixed appliances should be referred to an orthodontist. 
  
  
 Preventive orthodontic treatment by serial preventive extraction to create a space for anterior permanent teeth can be done by qualified dental personnel, if in he/she is in doubt it is recommended to consult dental specialist available. </div>

This wound is usually superficial, denudes the epithelium, and occasionally involves deeper layer. Contusion: <br> <br> is more commonly called a bruised and indicates that some amount of tissue disruption has occurred within the tissues, which resulted in subcutaneous or sub mucosal hemorrhage without a break in the soft tissue surface. Laceration: <br> <br> is a tear in the epithelial and sub epithelial tissues. It is perhaps the most frequent type of soft tissue injury, is caused most commonly by a sharp object 
 
 Treatment  <br> Give tetanus toxoid (0.5% IU)  <br> Check for facial fractures and trauma to other sites,  rule out evidence of head Injury (amnesia, loss of consciousness, neurological signs)  <br> Intra-oral examination: <br> <br> Look for soft-tissue lacerations, dentoalveolar fractures and damage to teeth. <br> Check for tooth fragments which may be displaced in soft tissues <br> Examine traumatized teeth for mobility and check mobility <br> X-rays: <br> <br>  (periapical x-ray) especially  for suspected root fracture, and OPG x-ray for suspected alveolar bone fracture and jaw fracture <br> Suture for any soft tissue wounds <br> Wash mouth with warm saline solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Repeat mouth wash3 times daily. <br> Medication prescribed for elimination of pain; give analgesic (paracetamol or diclofenac or ibuprofen). <br> Give prophylactic antibiotics if indicated. Antibiotic cover in cases of suspected contamination or extensive damage  (Amoxicillin (oral) 500 mg  8hrly for 5 days). 
  
 <br> Efforts should be made to save the permanent tooth unless there is root fracture. Restoration of aesthetics (composite filling, prosthesis). <br> Extraction is treatment of choice for significantly traumatized primary/deciduous teeth with mobility and or displacement. Judge the time which the tooth had to remain before expected exfoliation.

    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematodes) of the genus 
Schistosoma. Common 
species found in Tanzania are S. haematobium responsible for urogenital Schistosomiasis and S. mansoni responsible for intestinal Schistosomiasis. Infection is through the larval forms of the parasite which is released by freshwater snails. The parasite then, penetrates the skin during contact with infested water. In the body, the larvae develop into adult schistosomes. Adult worms live in the blood vessels, where the females release eggs. Some of the eggs are passed out of the body in the feces or urine to continue the parasite life-cycle. Others become trapped in body tissues, causing an immune reaction and progressive damage to organs. 
 
Diagnosis Schistosoma mansoni <br> There may be abdominal pain and frequent blood stained stool 
 
<br> In chronic form of 
Schistosoma mansoni ; abdominal distention, and vomiting of blood and liver fibrosis (Portal hypertension) <br> People co-infected with either hepatitis B or C and S mansoni have been shown to have rapid progression of liver disease. 
 
Schistosoma hematobium <br> The main clinical feature is painless terminal hematuria <br> In chronic and complicated situations can lead to renal failure due to obstructive uropathy, pyelonephritis, or bladder carcinoma (10-20 years after the initial infection) <br> In addition, immune complexes that contain worm antigens may deposit in the glomeruli, leading to glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis. Laboratory diagnosis Perform stool or urine analysis to identify and specify the eggs in the stool or urine. Kato Katz thick fecal smear technique is needed for chronic disease stage of the iintestine and liver. Diagnostic yields are improved by repeated stool samples and from biopsies at sigmoidoscopy. Schistosomal ELISA confirms exposure and if negative reliably excludes infection.

Diagnosis <br> After a 24 to 48 hours incubation period, cholera begins with the sudden onset of painless watery diarrhea that may quickly become severe with profuse watery stools (rice water), vomiting, severe dehydration and muscular cramps leading to hypovolemic shock and death <br> The stool has a characteristic “rice water” appearance (non bilious, gray, slightly cloudy fluid with flecks of mucus, no blood and inoffensive odor) 
 
 
Laboratory Diagnosis Dark field microscopy on a wet mount of fresh stool for identification of motile curved bacillus. Isolation through stool culture is best done through TCBS agar. Vibrio serotype can be discerned by immobilization with specific antiserum. . Treatment <br> Rehydration, electrolytes and base correction is the most important step <br> Management of severely dehydrated patient, IV fluid replacement is preferable <br> Oral rehydration is indicated in moderate forms of dehydration but is ineffective in the presence of significant vomiting 
 
 
 
For Severe dehydration <br> Administer intravenous (I.V) fluid immediately to replace fluid deficit; Use lactated Ringer solution or, if that is not available, isotonic sodium chloride solution. <br> For patients older than 1 year, give 100 mls/kg I.V in 3 hours—30 mls/kg as rapidly as possible (within 30 min) then 70 mls/kg in the next 2 hours. For patients younger than 1 year, administer 100 mls/kg IV in 6 hours—30 mls/kg in the first hour then 70 mls/kg in the next 5 hours. Monitor the patient frequently. <br> After the initial 30 mls/kg has been administered, the radial pulse should be strong and blood pressure should be normal. If the pulse is not yet strong, continue to give I.V fluid rapidly. Administer ORS solution (about 5 mls/kg/h) as soon as the patient can drink, in addition to I.V fluid. <br> If the patient can drink, begin giving oral rehydration salt solution (ORS) by mouth while the drip is being set up; ORS can provide the potassium, bicarbonate, and glucose that saline solution lacks. <br> Reassess the hydration status after 3 hours (infants after 6 hrs), In the rare case that the patient still exhibits signs of severe dehydration, repeat the I.V therapy protocol. If signs of some dehydration are present, continue as indicated below for some dehydration. If no signs of dehydration exist, maintain hydration by replacing ongoing fluid losses. <br> Start antibiotics (see regimen below) after the patient is rehydrated and vomiting has stopped usually after 4-6 hours. Although the disease is self limiting, an effective antibiotic will reduce the volume of diarrhea and shorten the period during which Vibrio cholera is excreted. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be given to all close contacts in the same dosage as for treatment. <br> Start feeding 3-4 hours after oral rehydration begins. Preferably, give antibiotics with food to minimize vomiting. 
 
In moderate Dehydration <br> Give oral rehydration, approximately 75-100ml/kg in the first four hours <br> Reassess after four hours; if improved, continue giving WHO based ORS, in quantity corresponding to losses (eg after each stool) or 10 to 20ml/kg. If not improved, treat as severe 
 
If no signs of dehydration <br> For patients who have no signs of dehydration when first observed can be treated at home <br> Give these patients ORS packets to take home, enough for 2 days <br> Demonstrate how to prepare and give the solution <br> Instruct the patient or the caretaker to return if any of the following signs develop; increased number of watery stools repeated vomiting or any signs indicating other problems (eg, fever, blood in stool).

    <td>General management of diarrheal diseases</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Diarrhea is defined as the abrupt onset of abnormally high fluid content in the stool: <br> <br> more than the normal value of approximately 10 mls/kg/d in the infant and young child, and more than 200 g/d in the teenager and adult. This situation typically implies an increased frequency of bowel movements, which can range from 4-5 to more than 20 times per day. The augmented water content in the stools is due to an imbalance in the physiology of the small and large intestinal processes involved in the absorption of ions, organic substrates, and thus water. 
Childhood acute diarrhea is usually caused by infection; however, numerous disorders may cause this condition, including a malabsorption syndrome and various enteropathies. Acuteonset diarrhea is usually self-limited; however, an acute infection can have a protracted course. By far, the most common complication of acute diarrhea is dehydration. 
Diarrheal episodes are classically distinguished into acute and chronic (or persistent) based on their duration. Acute diarrhea is thus defined as an episode that has an acute onset and lasts no longer than 14 days; chronic or persistent diarrhea is defined as an episode that lasts longer than 14 days. This distinction is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
It is most practical to base treatment of diarrhea on the clinical types of the illness, which can easily be determined when a patient is first examined. Laboratory studies are very useful. Four 
<br><b>CAUTION</b>: <br> <br> Doxycycline should not be used in pregnancy and children below 12 years 
 
clinical types of diarrhea can be recognized, each reflecting the basic underlying pathology and altered pathology: <br> <br> <br> Acute Watery Diarrhoea (including Cholera): <br> <br> which lasts several hours or days. The main danger is dehydration and malnutrition if feeding is not continued <br> Bloody Diarrhoea (Dysentery): <br> <br> the main dangers are damage of intestinal mucosa, sepsis, and malnutrition. Other complications including dehydration may also occur <br> Persistent (Chronic) Diarrhoe<b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Last for 14 days or longer, the main danger is malnutrition and serious non-intestinal infections, dehydration may also occur <br> Dirrhoea with Severe Malnutrition (Marasmus or Kwashiorkor): <br> <br> the main dangers are severe systemic infection, dehydration, heart failure, vitamin and mineral deficiency.<b> Note: <br> <br></b><br> The basis for the management of each type of dirrhoea is to prevent or treat dangers that present. I. Management of diarrhea in children <br> Over 90% of deaths from diarrhea in under-fives would be prevented by: <br> <br> <br> Continuing breast feeding and other feeding throughout the attack of diarrhea (prevent malnutrition) <br> Making sure mothers know when to take the child to a health facility <br> Correct assessment, treatment and continued feeding at the health facility level (See IMCI from the MoHSW manual) <br> Treatment of invasive diarrhea (bloody stool) with antibiotics <br> Treating or preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance with ORS (New osmolarity ORS) <br> Reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea and occurrence of future episodes by giving supplemental Zinc <br> Referring to hospital for investigation and treatment for severe malnutrition and persistent diarrhea (lasting>14 days) 
Other signs which may be useful in assessing severe dehydration and influence management include: <br> <br> <br> Weight loss over a short period <br> Signs of hypovolemic shock: <br> <br> fast weak pulses, cold extremities, oliguria or anuria <br> Hyperventilation, deep and fast breathing indicating acidosis <br> Signs of severe malnutrition 
 
II. Management of diarrhea in adults The principles of management of diarrhea in adult are the same as in children in correction of fluid deficit. As much as possible the cause for diarrhea in adult should be established. Special care should be taken for patients who are immunodeficient e.g. in cases of HIV/AIDS; and/or those with associated chronic disease condition including malignancy. However, the most common cause for diarrhea in adult is food poisoning which is normally self-limiting.                                                                                                                                                                    Management of Chronic Diarrhea in Adults.                                                                             This may account to 5% but may be under estimation as many patients don’t seek medical attention. Causes may include: <br> <br> Medications, mal absorption syndrome, colitides, GI and neuro endocrine tumours, endocroniopathies, chronic infections, and dysmotility bowel syndrome. 
 
Clinical evaluation therefore needs detailed history and examination to determine the pathophysiologic mechanism of diarrhea which will help to stratify the modality of diagnostic evaluation. 
Diagnostic evaluation involves;  
-Detailed stool analysis: <br> <br> PH, osmolarity, electrolytes, infectious etiologies including   clostridium deficile toxin assay, fecal occult blood, fecal fat assay, fecal leucocytes or lactoferin, fecal alpha antitrypsin or elastase, fecal chymotrypsin and laxative screen.                                                          - Full hemogram and ESR.                                                                                                                                -Comprehensive metabolic panel: <br> <br> liver functions, renal functions, thyroid functions;                         - Urine studies for protenuria and laxative screen, urinary metanephrines and histamines.                   - Hormonal assays: <br> <br> serum levels of VIP, gastrin, calcitonin, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, tryptase.                                                                                                                          - Serum protein immunoglobulins electrophoresis. 
Treatment Guide: <br> <br> 
- Correct volume status, electrolyte disturbances and vitamin deficiencies.                                        - Treat specific underlying cause(s)                                                                                        -  For mild to moderate diarrhea use Loperamide 2- 4mg 6hrly (O) or Diphenoxylate with Atropine 4mg 6hrly.                                                                                                                     - In established secretory diarrhea, Octreotide 50 – 250 mcg 12 hrly (SC) is indicated to decrease the volume of stool.                                                                                                           – Empiric treatment with  Metronidazole 400mg 8hrly(O) or Ciprofloxacin 500 12 hrly(O) for 5 7 days  can be considered if patient is at high risk of dehydration, development of systemic complication, or high prevalence of infectious diarrhea in the community.                                           – Surgical treatment is indicated in established conditions such as, neuro endocrine tumor (NET), severe colitis, or malignancy.</div>

    <td>DISORDERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT /Peptic Ulcer Disease</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">The term peptic ulceration refers to an ulcer in the lower esophagus; stomach and duodenum. They have in common the involvement of acid-pepsin in their pathogenesis leading to disruption of the mucosal integrity causing local defect or excavation due to active inflammation. The common ulcers are duodenal and/or gastric. 
Peptic ulcer may present in many different ways, the commonest is chronic, episodic pain present in many different ways, and may persist for months or years. However, the ulcer may come to attention as an acute episode with bleeding or perforation, with little or no previous history. As with duodenal ulcer, epigastric pain is the commonest symptom of gastric ulcer. 
 
2.1.1 Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease. (GERD) It is a disorder resulting from gastric acid and other gastric contents into the esophagus due to incompetent barriers at the gastro esophageal junction. 
 
Diagnosis <br> Heartburn and regurgitation of sour material into the mouth are specific symptoms <br> Symptoms for persistent disease may include odynophagia, dysphagia, weight loss and bleeding <br> Extra esophageal manifestation are due to reflux of gastric contents into the pharynx, larynx, trachealbrochial tree, nose and mouth causing chronic cough, laryngitis, pharyngitis. It may also cause or aggravate chronic bronchitis, asthma, COPD, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis and dental decay. 
 
Investigation Diagnosis clinically by history alone and therapeutic trial of H2 receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) such as cimetidine 400mg 12hourly or  Omeprazole 40mg 12 hourly respectively for 1 week, provides support for diagnosis of GERD. Esophagoscopy is valuable but not diagnostic for GERD, double contrast Barium meal is acceptable alternative to patient unwilling to undergo endoscopy. The 24-hours esophageal PH Metry is the specific procedure to confirm presence of GERD. 
 
Treatment The goals of treatment are to provide symptom relief, heal erosive esophagitis and prevent complication. Life style changes and antisecretory agents may be adequate. 
 
Drug of choice is H2 Receptor blockers which are effective in symptoms relief and are considered as first line <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Ranitidine 150mg (O) 12 hourly for 14 days; Children 2 -4mg/kg 12 hourly for 14 days. 
Proton Pump inhibitors (PPI) are considered as second line and are much more effective in healing ulcers or erosive esophagitis. 
 
Drug of Choice 
<b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b>Omeprazole 20mg (O) once daily for 4 -8 weeks

Alternatively 
<br><b>D: <br> <br></b> Esomeprazole 40mg (O) once daily for 4-8 weeks, then 20mg once daily for maintenance to prevent relapse. 
 
Referral Refer to specialized centers for all cases with persistent symptoms and/or new complications despite appropriate treatment above. NOTE Specific lifestyle changes for patient advice may include <br> Reduce spices, and avoid foods and fruits that exacerbate pain in individual patients <br> Stop smoking and avoid alcohol <br> Low consumption of coffee or tea <br> Avoid carbonated drinks <br> Avoid medicines such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) aspirin, steroids. 
 
2.1.2 Gastro duodenal Ulcers (PUD) General Management <br> Consider peptic ulcer general measures as above <br> Referral to a specialist is recommended in presence of persistent symptoms or new onset complications <br> Endoscopic biopsy to exclude malignancy in all refractory cases is mandatory <br> Evaluation and treatment of H. Pylori associated infection is mandatory for effective treatment. 
 
Management of Helicobacter pylori infection Gastric infection with the bacterium H.Pylori accounts for majority of PUD. It also plays role in development of gastric mucosal – associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) Lymphoma and Gastric adenocarcinoma. 
 
Laboratory diagnosis <br> Perform stool antigen testing; the test should be repeated 3 months after therapy to confirm eradication <br> Perform urea breath tests; the test require the patient to be off PPI therapy for 14 days and same days after eradication therapy 
 
<br> Perform biopsy for urease test; more specific, helpful in cases where antibiotic sensitivity testing is required <br> Serology confirms the exposure but not necessarily an active infection 
 
Treatment Triple therapy is indicated for complete eradication of the organism. Omeprazole (PO) 20mg twice daily + Amoxicillin (PO)1g twice daily + Metronidazole (PO) 400mg twice daily for 7 days OR Lansoprazole (PO) 30mg twice daily + Clarithromycin (PO) 250mg twice + Tinidazole (PO) 500mg twice daily for 7 days. </div>

    <div class="s-df">Acute gastro intestinal (GI) bleeding is common medical emergency resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. It can occur anywhere from mouth to anus; it is therefore subdivided into upper gastrointestinal bleeding(UGIB), anatomically above the ligament of Treitz; and lower gastrointestinal bleeding(LGIB), which is further subdivided to small bowel bleeding(middle GIB) and Colonic bleeding. 
Causes for UGIB include, erosive ulcerative disease, esophagitis, portal varices and gastropathy, vascular ectasias, Mallory weiss tear and tumours. Causes for LGIB include, Diverticular disease, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, infectious and radiation colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, polyps, tumours, vascular ectasias and intussusceptions especially in children. 
Diagnostic guide 
Begin with an assessment of patient’s hemodynamic status (normal, orthostatic hypotension, or shock), while trying to localize the acute GIB through focused history and examination. Include the following in history, description of bleeding, duration and frequency, prior bleeding, cormobidities, medications, previous surgery, recent polypectomy or prior radiation.  
 
Assess for the vital signs, stigmata of liver disease, abdominal tenderness, stool colour by rectal examination, nasogatric aspiration may show a positive gastric aspirate. 
Diagnostic procedures: <br> <br> 
Do baseline investigation, Full hemogram, Coagulopathy profile, liver and renal functions. Specifically, upper and lower endoscopy is appropriately indicated. While Tagged red cell scan and Angiography would be indicated for rapidly or obscure bleeding patients. 
Treatment guide

- Intravascular volume replacement should be restored with either ringers lactate or isotonic saline through large bore IV lines.                                                        
- Blood transfusion with packed red blood cells should immediately follow.  Correct severe thrombocytopenia with packed platelet concentrates, while overt coagulopathy should be corrected with fresh frozen plasma, and Vitamin K S.C injection 5 -10 mg stat given to stable patients. 
- Institute (IV) proton pump inhibitors e.g. Esomeprazole 40mg 12hrly. For 3-5 days, then oral therapy up to 6 weeks. 
- Add Octreotide 50mcg (IV) stat then 50mcg 8hrly (IV) for 3-5 days specifically for varecial bleeding 
- Add ciprofloxacin 400mg 12hrly (IV), or Metronidazole 500 8hrly (IV), or Ceftriaxone 1gm 12hrly (IV) for 3-7 days especially in varecial bleeding. 
2.  Non Pharmacological  
- Endoscopy done within 24 hours could confirm diagnosis and provide sustained hemostasis control. Therapeutic modalities include variceal band ligation, Hemocliping, sclerotherapy, injectional tamponade therapy, thermocoagulation and angiographic embolization. 
3. Surgical Management 
-  TIPS or shunt therapy is indicated in patients with esophageal varices who have failed pharmacologic and endoscopy therapy or those with bleeding gastric fundic varices. 
- Surgical laparatomy for small bowel resection or colectomy is indicated as salvage therapy for small group of patients whom pharmacological, endescopic, and angiotherapy have failed.

    <td>DISORDERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT/Inflammatory Bowel Disease</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease, probably involving an immune reaction of the body to its own intestinal tract. The 2 major types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). As the name suggests, ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon. Crohn disease can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus 
 
 2.4.1 Ulcerative colitis Inflammatory condition that affects the rectum extends proximally to affect a variable amount of the colon. Smoking appears to worsen the disease condition. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> Active disease is associated with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain <br> Severity of symptoms correlates with the extent of disease <br> Occasionally, diarrhea and bleeding is intermittent and mild that the patient may not seek medical attention, thus though UC can present acutely, symptoms usually have been present for weeks to month <br> Complication may present as, Massive hemorrhage  ( &less; 1%); Toxic megacolon, Perforation with features of peritonitis, stricture. Note Diagnosis relies upon the patient’s history; clinical symptoms; negative stool examination for bacteria, C.difficile toxin, ova and parasites; sigmoidoscopic appearance; and histology of rectal or colonic biopsy specimen. Single contrast barium enema alternative to sigmoidoscopy but is limited by biopsy access. Supportive laboratory test: <br> <br> CBC for anemia; Thrombocytosis, leucocytosis may reflect active disease. 
  
 Treatment and Referral <br> Refer patients to specialized centers once disease is suspected for expertise management <br> Cure is not available, goals of therapy are to induce and maintain remission 
  
 Drug of Choice <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Sulphasalazine (PO): <br> <br> Adults, 1 gram four times a day for acute disease, reducing to 500mg four times a day for maintenance; Children over 2 years for acute attack use 40-60mg/kg body weight daily. Maintenance dose 20-30mg/kg body weight daily. 
  Plus 
 B: <br> <br> Prednisolone (PO) 30-60mg once daily for severe, acute and extensive disease; reduces gradually according to disease severity. 
 Note 
  
 <br> Correction of fluid deficit and/or blood is important in acute severe forms which may necessitates hospitalization <br> Nutritional therapy should target to replenish specific nutrient deficits <br> Life long surveillance is required due to risk of bowel cancer <br> Use steroids only when the disease is confirmed, to avoid exacerbation of existing illness. 
  
 2.4.2 Crohn’s Disease Crohn’s disease is an idiopathic, chronic, transmural inflammatory process of the bowel that often leads to fibrosis and obstructive symptoms and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> Mainly abdominal pain and diarrhea; weight loss, anorexia, and fever may be seen <br> Growth retardation in children <br> Gross rectal bleeding or acute hemorrhage is uncommon <br> Anemia is a common complication due to illeal disease involvement <br> Small bowel obstruction, due to stricturing <br> Perianal disease associated with fistulization <br> Gastroduodenal involvement may be mistaken for H.Pylori negative PUD 
  
 Diagnostic consideration <br> Endoscopy gold standard for diagnosing colonic and terminal illeal disease and readily permits mucosal biopsy and balloon dilatation of any stricture <br> Barium follow through is still standard method for evaluating the small bowel, though capsule enterescopy is superior <br> Discriminating features that favours Crohn’s from Ulcerative colitis include small bowel disease, mainly right sided colonic disease, rectal sparing, fistulization, and granulomas. Immunological makers: <br> <br> pANCA is predictive in 70% of UC but only15% in CD; Antibodies to Saccharomyces cervisiae are found in up to 50% CD and less often in UC. When done together specificity is further improved <br> Supportive laboratory tests: <br> <br> CBC for anemia; thrombocytosis, leucocytosis, as serrogate sign of inflammation, iron and folate studies, liver functions test,  electrolytes/micronutrient deficiency  assessment (calcium, magnesium, zinc). 
  
 Treatment <br> Refer suspected cases to specialized centers for expertise management <br> Baseline management as for Ulcerative Colitis above 
  
 2.4.3 Pseudomembrenous colitis Clostridium difficile is organism responsible for an infectious colitis that affects 1 of every 200 patients who are admitted to the hospital. Increasingly implicated as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, C difficile colitis should also be recognized 
  
 among outpatient populations. Prior antibiotic exposure remains the most significant risk factor for development of disease. Antibiotics first seen with clindamycin, but amoxylin and the cephalosporin’s are now most frequently implicated. Extreme age, recent GI surgery, malignancy, prolonged hospital stay  are  other risk factors. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> Diarrhea and abdominal cramps occurs during first week, but can be delayed up to six weeks <br> Nausea, fever, dehydration can accompany severe colitis <br> Abdominal examination may reveal distension and tenderness. 
  
 Note <br> Stool examination is sensitive on anaerobic culture facilities which reveals toxigenic and non toxigenic strains <br> Enzyme immunoassays are available for toxins A and B in stool <br> Sigmoidoscopy is highly specific if lesion is seen but insensitive compared to the above.

    <td>DISORDERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT/ Malabsorption syndrome</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Malabsorption is a clinical term that encompasses defects occurring during the digestion and absorption of food nutrients by and infections of the gastrointestinal tract. Although presenting symptoms, such as diarrhea and weight loss may be common, the specific causes of malabsorption are usually established based on physiologic evaluations. The treatment often depends on the establishment of a definitive etiology for malabsorption. Etiologic examples include pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, celiac disease, tropical sprue, lactase deficiency, diabetic enteropathy, thyroid disease, radiation enteritis, gastrectomy and extensive small bowel resection.  
 
 
 Diagnosis Depending on etiology, presentation may collectively include: <br> <br> <br> Diarrhoea a commonest symptom which is frequently watery  <br> Steatorrhea due to fat malabsorption; characterized, by the passage of pale, bulky, and malodorous stools.  Stools often float on top of the toilet water and are difficult to flush <br> Weight loss and fatigue  <br> Flatulence and abdominal distention  <br> Edema due to hypoalbuminemia, and with severe protein depletion ascites may develop <br> Anemias which can either be microcytic iron deficiency (celiac disease) or macrocytic vitamin B-12 deficiency (chrohn’s disease or illeal resection). <br> Bleeding disorders (Ecchymosis, melena, and hematuria) due to vitamin K malabsorption and subsequent hypoprothrombinemia.  <br> Metabolic defects of bones (osteopenia or osteomalacia) due to vitamin D deficiency. Bone pain and pathologic fractures may be observed. Malabsorption of calcium can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
  
 <br> Neurologic manifestations: <br> <br> Electrolyte disturbances, such as hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia, can lead to tetany. Vitamin malabsorption can cause generalized motor weakness (pantothenic acid, vitamin D) or peripheral neuropathy (thiamine), a sense of loss for vibration and position (cobalamin), night blindness (vitamin A), and seizures (biotin).  
  
 Treatment <br> Patients should be referred to specialized centers for proper evaluation and definitive    management <br> Two basic principles underlie the management of patients with malabsorption, as follows: <br> <br>  o The correction of nutritional deficiencies o When possible, the treatment of causative diseases <br> Nutritional support  o Supplementing various minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins, which may be deficient in malabsorption, is important  o Caloric and protein replacement also is essential  o Medium-chain triglycerides can be used as fat substitutes because they do not require micelle formation for absorption and their route of transport is portal rather than lymphatic  o In severe intestinal disease, such as massive resection and extensive regional enteritis, parenteral nutrition may become necessary.  
  
 <br> Treatment of causative diseases  o A gluten-free diet helps treat celiac disease o A lactose-free diet helps correct lactose intolerance; supplementing the first bite of milk-containing food products with Lactaid also helps o Protease and lipase supplements are the therapy for pancreatic insufficiency  o Antibiotics are the therapy for bacterial overgrowth o Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory agents, such as mesalamine, and other therapies are used to treat regional enteritis. </div>

    <td>DISORDERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT/ Pancreatitis </td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Pancreatitis is an inflammatory process in which pancreatic enzymes auto digest the gland. It may present as acute pancreatitis, in which the pancreas can sometimes heal without any impairment of function or any morphologic changes, or as chronic pancreatitis, in which individuals suffer recurrent, intermittent attacks that contribute to the functional and morphologic loss of the gland. 
 
 2.7.1 Acute Pancreatitis It is due to sudden inflammation of the pancreas due to pancreatic enzymes auto digestion.  Common risk factors which trigger the acute episode are presence of gallstones and alcohol intake.  
  
 Diagnosis <br>● Severe, unremitting epigastric pain, radiating to the back  <br>● Nausea and vomiting 
  
 <br>● Signs of shock may be present <br>● Ileus is also common <br>● Local complications: <br> <br> inflammatory mass, obstructive jaundice, gastric outlet obstruction <br>● Systemic complication: <br> <br> sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure 
  
 Diagnostic considerations <br> Serum amylase, in counts over 1000U/L, but poor correlates with disease severity. Serum Lipase twice the normal limit has superior sensitivity and specificity. <br> Complete blood counts, Urea and electrolytes, bicarbonate levels, liver transaminases and albumin, LDH, glucose, calcium, CRP, and lipid profile for modified Glasgow criteria to disease severity and outcomes. <br> Abdominal ultrasound, Plain abdominal X-ray, Chest X-ray, CT Abdomen. 
  
 Treatment <br> Prompt referral to specialized centers with intensive care facilities is recommended <br> Principles of management include expertise supportive therapy: <br> <br>  o Nil per oral regimen for few days up to weeks is indicated depending on severity. o Intravascular volume expansion (colloids/crystalloid) o Opiates analgesia and antiemetics usually required. o Prophylactic antibiotics in severe state, useful when there is evidence of sepsis(IV) ceftriaxone 1g 12hrly + Metronidazole 500mg 8hrly or Meronem 1g 8hrly o ERCP + Sphincterotomy when gallstones are present in the CBD. 
  
 2.7.2 Chronic Pancreatitis Chronic pancreatitis is long-term (chronic) inflammation of the pancreas that leads to permanent damage. The most common cause for such a condition is long-term excessive alcohol consumption. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> The most common symptom is upper abdominal pain that may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite <br>  As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is destroyed, pain may actually become less severe <br> During an attack, the pain often is made worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large meal high in fats. <br> Because a damaged pancreas can’t produce important digestive enzymes, people with chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and nutrients. This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea and greasy, foulsmelling stools. <br> Over time, a damaged pancreas also can fail to produce enough insulin, which results in Diabetes. 
  
 Diagnostic Consideration: <br> <br> <br>● Abdominal X-ray, for evidence of pancreatic calcifications <br>● CT, MRCP, ERCP, and Endoscopic ultrasound are complementary <br>● Biochemical; Glucose tolerance test, serum vitamins (ADEK), hemoglobin and calcium levels,     <br>●Pancreatic function tests: <br> <br> Secretin /CCK – secretory test, fecal elastese1 concentrations 
  
  
 Treatment Referral is recommended for expertise evaluation and management in specialized centers. Because chronic pancreatitis cannot be cured, direct the treatment towards: <br> <br> <br> Relieving pain with pain-killers- In rare cases, surgery/ ERCP to open blocked ducts or remove part of the pancreas may be done to relieve pain. <br> Improving food absorption - The patient should be recommended to follow a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet that also restricts some types of fats. Once digestive problems are treated, patient will usually gain back weight and diarrhea improves. Another way is by giving the patient pancreatic supplements containing digestive enzymes. <br> Treating diabetes - Treat diabetes with careful attention to diet to help keep blood sugar levels stable. In some people, insulin injections and other diabetic medications are needed. </div>

    <td>DISORDERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT/ Peritonitis</td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Refers to inflammation of the peritoneum; it may be localized or diffuse in location, acute or chronic in natural history, infectious or aseptic in pathogenesis. Acute peritonitis is most often infectious usually related to a perforated viscus (secondary peritonitis); primary or spontaneous peritonitis refers to when no intraabdominal source is identified. Acute peritonitis is associated with decreased intestinal motility, resulting in distention of the intestinal lumen with gas and fluid. The accumulation of fluid in the bowel together with the lack of oral intake leads to rapid intravascular depletion with effects on cardiac, renal, and other systems. 
 
 Chronic peritonitis refers to longstanding inflammation of the peritoneum. Causes include repeated attacks of infection such as from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Metastatic lesions or foreign substances that induce inflammation, and chronic infections within the abdomen such as Tuberculosis. 
  
  
 Diagnosis <br> Acute peritonitis is usually characterized by acute abdominal pain and tenderness, dehydration, fever, hypotension, nausea and vomiting and tachycardia.  <br> Complications include abscess formation, oliguria and shock. <br> Similar features may be seen in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which occurs in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Bacterial translocation, bacteraemia and impaired antimicrobial activity contribute to its development. Gram negative bacilli (E. coli) commonly are a causative microbe.    
  
 Diagnostic considerations: <br> <br> (specific) <br> Peritoneal fluid analysis for microscopy, microbiology, culture and sensitivity <br> Macroscopic evaluation of the peritoneal fluid will exclude hemoperitoneum in trauma cases <br> Blood cultures due to bacterimia <br> Scanning procedures (ultrasound and/or CT scan) facilitates the diagnosis, Abdominal having   the highest diagnostic yield.   
  
  
  
  
 Treatment considerations Surgery remains a cornerstone of peritonitis treatment.   Antimicrobial therapy is adjunctive to surgical correction of underlying lesion or process and treatment will depend on causative agent.  Where cause is not known antibiotics of choice are: <br> <br>  <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Ampicillin (I.V) 1g every 6hours for 5-10 days  Plus  <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Gentamicin (I.V) 4 mg/kg/24 hours in 3 divided doses for 5-10 days  Plus  <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Metronidazole (I.V)/ (O) 400-600mg every 8 hours for 5-10 days.

Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Contributory factors may include inactivity, low fiber diet and inadequate water intake. Specific causes may include, conditions associated with neurologic dysfunction, scleroderma, drugs, hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, Cushing’s syndrome, colonic tumours, anorectal pain, and psychological factors. Diagnosis <br> Fewer than three bowel movements per week, small, hard, dry stools that is difficult or painful to pass, need to strain excessively to have a bowel movement, frequent use of enemas, laxatives or suppositories are characteristic. <br> Other features may include; abdominal bloating, rectal bleeding, spurious diarrhea, low back pain, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and tenesmus. 
 
 Referral The following signs and symptoms, if present, are grounds for urgent evaluation or referral: <br> <br> <br> Rectal bleeding  <br> Abdominal pain  <br> Inability to pass flatus  <br> Vomiting  <br> Unexplained weight loss. 
  
 Diagnostic guides: <br> <br> An extensive work up of the constipated patient is performed on an outpatient basis and usually occurs after approximately 3-6 months of failed medical management. It is advised to refer the patient at this juncture to specialized centers. 
  
 Laboratory evaluation may include a complete blood count (CBC), fecal occult blood especially in middle-aged or elderly adults; Thyroid function tests, serum chemistry to exclude metabolic causes of constipation.  Imaging studies are used to rule out acute processes that may be causing colonic ileus or to evaluate causes of chronic constipation. Lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, colonic transit study, defecography, anorectal manometry, surface anal electromyography (EMG), and balloon expulsion may be used in the evaluation of constipation.  In the acute situation with a patient at low risk who usually is not constipated, no further evaluation is necessary. Consider sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or barium enema for colorectal cancer screening in patients older than 50 years. Colonoscopy represents the current criterion standard.

    <td>
    <div class="s-df">This is a medical condition defined by the inflammation of the liver and characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to jaundice, anorexia  and malaise. Hepatitis is acute when it lasts less than six months and chronic when it persists longer. A group of hepatotropic viruses cause most cases of hepatitis worldwide, but it can also be due to other viral infections( e.g Cytomegalo, Epstein –Barr, Coxsackie viruses), toxins notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic solvents and plants,  autoimmune diseases and metabolic disease. 
 
 
 3.1.1 Acute Viral Hepatitis It is a systemic infection affecting the liver predominantly. Almost all cases of acute viral hepatitis are caused by one of five hepatotropic viral agents: <br> <br> Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), HBV – associated delta agent or Hepatitis D virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E virus (HEV).  
  
 Diagnosis Acute infection with a hepatitis virus may result in conditions ranging from subclinical disease to self-limited symptomatic disease to fulminant hepatic failure.  
 Collectively patients may develop fever, anorexia, malaise, jaundice, abdominal pain after specific incubation periods; and in severe forms signs of acute liver failure including altered consciousness may be present. 
  
 Diagnostic guides Quantitative analysis for presence of specific antibodies and/or antigenemia is mandatory for establishing a specific causative viral agent. The severity of liver injury is determined by transaminases levels (ALT) in particular, and more precisely by liver biopsy. The viremia is determined through PCR method and for some viral subtypes through genotyping. 
  
 Treatment guides Acute infection is usually self limiting, especially for HAV, HEV, and only 80% of HBV, and 20% of HCV cases. Supportive management is all that is required during acute illness, except in fulminant cases where specific antiviral medication may be required. 
<b> Note: <br> <br></b><br> Refer all cases of suspected Hepatitis to referral centers for expertise management. 
 3.1.2 Chronic viral Hepatitis There is an on going inflammatory reaction in the liver for at least 6 months. The most common causative hepatropic viral agents are HBV, HCV, and HDV. Non viral cause may include, drugs (methyldopa, Isoniazid), autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, hemochromatosis, αantitrypsin deficiency. Notably disease chronicity can progress into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer in span of years if no early treatment is initiated. 
  
 Diagnosis <br> There is a wide clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic serum amino- transaminases elevations to apparently acute and even fulminant hepatitis. <br> Common symptoms include, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, low grade fever; jaundice is frequent in severe disease.  <br> Some patients may present with complications of cirrhosis: <br> <br> ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hypersplenism. Some extra hepatic features may also predominate.(urticaria, arthritis, vasculitis, polyneuropathy, glomerulonephritis, thyroditis) 
  
 Diagnostic guides: <br> <br> In addition to the above guides, surveillance studies for development of cirrhosis and its complications or HCC include utrasonography, CT scan, serum α - feto protein. 
  
 Treatment  
  B: <br> <br> Lamuvidine 150mg (O) once daily.  OR  B: <br> <br> Tenofovir 300mg (O) once daily

 Diagnostic features <br> Include jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, features of increased estrogen levels in men, while in women there are features of increased androgen levels. Loss of libido, testicular atrophy and impotence are common among male cirrhotic.  <br> In women predominant features are breast atrophy, menstrual disturbances including amenorrhea. Features of portal hypertension like splenomegaly, ascites, distended abdominal wall vessels and variceal   bleeding are common. <br> Hepatic encephalopathy and renal dysfunction is a sequel of associated complications. 
  
 Diagnostic guides  To include, complete blood count, liver functions, serum electrolytes, viral hepatitis panel (B, C, and D), autoimmune markers (AMA,ANA), and makers for associated metabolic disease (ceruloplasmin, ferritin), alpha fetoprotein, Imaging (ultrasonography with Doppler studies, CT, MRI) and Liver biopsy. 
  
 Treatment Guide In compensated cirrhosis: <br> <br>  <br>● Treat the cause and associated complications. <br>● Encourage high calorie diet and protein intake. 
  
 In decompensate cirrhosis: <br> <br> <br>● Treat specifically the manifestation of hepatic decompansation. e.g. ascites, hepatic  encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome,   GI bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. <br>● Liver transplantation is definitive treatment once an episode of decompansation has occurred. 
  
 Note It is advisable to refer patients with this condition to specialized centers for proper evaluation and treatment. A planned supportive management can then be continued at the referring centers.</div>

A COPD diagnosis   
<br> Diagnosed based on factors such as signs/symptoms, patient history, physical examination, chest X-rays. <br>  Is confirmed by a simple test called spirometry, which measures how deeply a person can breathe and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs.  
COPD Exacerbations: <br> <br> a sustained worsening of the patient’s condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day - to - day variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD.
 
Additionally, a generalized sub classification of exacerbations based on health-care utilization is proposed. <br> Mil<br><b>D: <br> <br></b> patient has an increased need for medication, which he/she can manage in his/her own normal environment. <br> Moderate: <br> <br> patient has an increased need for medication, and he/she feels the need to seek additional medical assistance. <br> Severe: <br> <br> patient/caregiver recognizes obvious and/or rapid deterioration in condition, requiring hospitalization.   
 
Clinical signs and symptoms. 
<br> Increased dyspnoea,  <br> Productive cough with altered sputum <br> Fever.  <br> Alternatively, the symptoms may be more nonspecific, such as malaise, fatigue, insomnia or sleepiness, and depression. 
The major diseases included in this category are: <br> <br> 
<br> Chronic bronchitis - a chronic, inflammatory condition of the bronchi characterized by coughing and expectoration (spitting-up) of sputum (mucous coughed-up from the lungs) occurring on most days and lasting 3 months or longer for at least two consecutive years. <br> Emphysema - a respiratory disorder that is characterized by enlargement and eventual destruction of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, through which oxygen passes from the lungs into the bloodstream.   <br> Bronchiectasis is characterized by inflamed and easily collapsible airways, obstruction to airflow, and frequent hospital visits and admissions. (See below). <br> Although asthma is also a condition that is associated with airway obstruction, and many people with COPD also suffer with asthma, as a general rule, asthma is not included under the category of COPD.

    <div class="s-df">Oral contraceptives (oestrogen – progestogen combinaitons) are used primarily for prevention of conception. It may also be used in treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea or endometriosis. 
 
 The goal of therapy in the use of these products for contraception is to provide optional prevention of pregnancy while minimizing the symptoms and long term risks associated with excess or deficiency of the oestrogen and progestogen components.The eligibility for hormonal contraception can be obtained from nearest family planning clinic or unit. 
 They fall into two major categories: <br> <br> 
 
 Combined oral contraceptives) COCs) <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Oestrogen 30 – 35 micrograms (as ethinyloestradiol) “Low Dose” <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Oestrogen 50 micrograms + progestogen “ High Dose” “Triphasic pills” – contain phased levels which closely mimic normal cyclical hormonal acitivity 
  
 <br> Lower oestrogen dose pills cause fever side effects than higher dose pills <br> Mid-cycle spotting  in patients on 30 microgram COCs can be managed by changing to 50 microgram COCs <br> Menstruation on COCs will be regular, light and short 
   
  
 Progestogen Only Pills (POPs) These contain norethisterone, or norethindrone or levonorgestrel.  This type is suitable for lactating mothers or women with mild or moderate hypertension. Menstrual irregularity is a more common side effect. 
 Management  Follow up: <br> <br> <br> Instruct women always to inform the doctor or nurse that they are on contraceptives while attending clinic or hospital. <br> Women on Oral Contraceptives need regular physical check-ups including blood pressure measurement every six months e.g. if women develop depression after starting OC. Need to Withdraw COCs or POPs <br> Pregnancy <br> Severe headaches especially associated with visual disturbances <br> Numbness or paresis of extremities <br> Unexplained chest pain or shortness of breath <br> Severe leg pains <br> Development of any of the absolute contra-indication conditions 
  
 Medicines Reducing the Effect of Oral Contraceptives The following drugs are likely to reduce the effectiveness of OCs and woman may become pregnant so the woman should be advised to use additional prevention method such as condom.  <br> Hypnotic/sedatives anti-migraine medication, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, diazepam <br> Antiaci<br><b>D: <br> <br></b>  Aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate <br> Anti TB as rifampicin <br> Antiretroviral as Nevirapine and Retonavir <br> Certain antibiotics as Ampicillin and other Penicillins and Tetracyclines. 
  
 Note <br> For long term use of these drug “High Dose” COCs – 50 micrograms should be used or other method of contraception 
  
 Drug made less effective by Oral Contraceptives Prescribers might consider increasing the doses of the following drugs, known with careful monitoring <br> Anticonvulsant <br> Ant diabetic agents <br> Anticoagulants <br> Antihypertensive agents (methyldopa) <br> Corticosteroid <br> Hypnotics, sedatives or other CNS depressants 
  
 Post Coital Contraception (“morning-after pill”) The method is applicable mostly after rape and unprotected sexual intercourse where pregnancy is not desired.Within 3 days (72 hours) of unprotected sexual intercourse, give 
  
  
 <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Combined oral Contraceptive ethinyloestradiol 100 mcg and levonorgestrel 500 mcg (2 high dose COC tablets)

    <div class="s-df">CHF is a clinical syndrome and has several causes. 
 
 Diagnosis The diagnosis of Chronic Heart failure requires the following features: <br> <br> <br> Symptoms of heart failure, typically breathlessness or fatigue, at rest or during exertion  <br> Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction preferably by Echocardiography (Systolic and/or Diastolic) <br> A clinical response to treatment is supportive but not sufficient for diagnosis Hence diagnosis and management of CHF should be sought at referral centres where at least echocardiography assessment can be performed.  
  
 Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is considered as precursor of symptomatic HF and is associated with high mortality.  
  
 Treatment 
  
 Treatment of Systolic Heart Failure (LVEF< 45 - 50%)   Aims of Treatment  <br> Prevention of  A) Disease leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure eg hypertension, coronary artery disease, valve disease etc  B) Progression to HF once cardiac dysfunction is established  <br> Maintenance or Improvement in quality of life <br> Improve survival  
  
 Non pharmacological management  <br> Patient and family education o Explain what HF is and why symptoms occurs, cause of HF, how to recognize symptoms and what to do when they occur, daily self-weighing and what to in case of weight gain. o Rationale of treatment, importance of adhering to drug & non drug prescription   o Refrain from smoking 
  
 o Prognosis <br> Drug counseling – Effects, doses and times of administration, side effects and adverse effects  <br> Dietary and social habit – control sodium intake when necessary, avoid excessive fluid intake in severe HF Limit fluid intake to 1–1.5 L/day if fluid overloaded despite diuretic therapy. Avoid excessive alcohol intake <br> Regular exercise within limits of symptoms. <br> Sexuality counsel regarding the risk of pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives & Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor are not recommended in advanced HF, if used nitrate should be avoided < 24 -48hours of nitrate intakes  <br> Drug to avoid or used with <br><b>caution</b>  o NSAIDs & Coxibs  o Class I anti-arrhythmics  o Calcium antagonists o Lithium o Tricyclic anti-depressants o Corticosteroid

 Pharmacological Treatment  Initial  <br> Anticoagulate with warfarin. <br> Control the ventricular rate with one of the following: <br> <br>       <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Digoxin oral, 0.25mg daily; use only in heart failure.              <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Atenolol, oral, 50–100 mg daily (contraindicated in asthmatics; <br><b>caution</b> in Heart failure). <br> DC cardioversion in selected cases, after 4 weeks Warfarin anticoagulation. 
  
  
 Long – term  <br> Continue Warfarin anticoagulation long-term, unless contra-indicate<br><b>D: <br> <br></b> Warfarin, oral, 5 mg daily.  Control with INR to therapeutic range: <br> <br> INR between 2–3: <br> <br> patient is stable do 3    monthly monitoring            If INR < 1.5 or > 3.5: <br> <br> do monthly monitoring Use: <br> <br> <br> Prophylaxis in chronic atrial fibrillation <br> Prior to cardioversion to sinus rhythm <br> In lone atrial fibrillation of persons 65 or older. If the patient has a prosthetic valve, ADD <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Aspirin, soluble, oral, 150 mg daily 
  
 <br><b>CAUTION</b> Use Warfarin only if INR can be monitored regularly.If not, consider use of aspirin. 
  
 Rate control Continue as above. Digoxin only controls rate at rest and is insufficient on its own. If used long-term, combine with s-blocker. In the elderly and patients with renal impairment: <br> <br> <b><br><br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> <br></b> Digoxin (O) 0.125 mg initial dose             Adjust dosages according to trough levels within the therapeutic range.             Do levels only if the patient has been on the drug for at least 10 days. <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Atenolol (O) 50–100 mg daily 
  
 Prevention of recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Only in patients with severe symptoms despite the above measures: <br> <br> <br><b>D: <br> <br></b> Amiodarone 200 mg (O) 8 hourly for 1 week, followed 200 mg twice daily for one week and thereafter 200 mg daily.

 Atrial Flutter 
  
 Non pharmacological Treatment – Electrical Cardioversion  Synchronised DC cardioversion, 200 J, after sedation with: <br> <br> <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Diazepam 10–20 mg IV If flutter has been present longer than 48 hours, defer cardioversion for 4 weeks after anticoagulation with warfarin, unless severe symptoms or heart failure require urgent conversion. 
  
 Pharmacological Treatment  None is nearly as effective as DC cardioversion. Most drugs have serious side effects. Do not use verapamil as it will not convert flutter to sinus rhythm and may cause serious hypotension. Anticoagulants if sustained. 
  
 Long term treatment: <br> <br> Recurrent atrial flutter is an indication for referral. Many can be cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation. 
  
 AV Junctional Re-Entry Tachycardias 
  
 Non Pharmacological Treatment  Vagal manoeuvres: <br> <br> Valsalva or carotid sinus massage. The patient should be supine and as relaxed as possible, to avoid competing sympathetic reflexes. 
  
 Pharmacological Treatment  If vagal manoeuvres fail: <br> <br> <br><b>D: <br> <br></b> Adenosine, rapid IV bolus, 6 mg through a good IV line, followed by a bolus of 10 mL Sodium chloride 0.9% to ensure that it reaches the heart before it is broken down.                              Run the ECG for 1 minute after the injection.             If 6 mg fails, repeat with 12 mg.             If the drug reaches the central circulation before it is broken down the patient will experience flushing, sometimes chest pain and anxiety.  If the tachycardia fails to terminate without these symptoms, the drug did not reach the heart. If none of the above is effective, or if the patient is hypotensive, consider DC shock. 
  
 <br><b>CAUTION</b>‼ Verapamil and digoxin are contraindicated in WPW syndrome. 
  
  
 Long – term Treatment  Teach the patient to perform vagal manoeuvres, Valsalva is the most effective. For infrequent, non-incapacitating symptoms: <br> <br> ß –Blockers e.g.: <br> <br> <b><br><br> A: <br> <br> <br> <br></b> Atenolol 50–100 mg (O) daily (If asthmatic) OR <br><b>D: <br> <br></b> Verapamil (O) 80–120 mg three times daily (Normal heart)

<b> Note: <br> <br></b><br> For emergency treatment of ventricular tachycardia, DC cardioversion is first-line therapy, even if stable 
  
 (B)      SUSTAINED (> 30 SECONDS) IRREGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS If the QRS complexes have a pattern of typical right or left bundle branch block, with a rate < less than 170/minute, treat as for atrial fibrillation. See Section for Atrial fibrillation.  If the rate is > 170 per minute, and/or the complexes are atypical or variable, the likely diagnosis is WPW syndrome with atrial fibrillation, conducting via the bypass tract, DC conversion. 
  
 Do not treat with drugs Verapamil and digoxin may precipitate ventricular fibrillation by increasing the ventricular rate. 
  
 (C)        NON-SUSTAINED (< 30 SECONDS) IRREGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS Most are ventricular. In acute myocardial infarction, only treat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia if it causes significant haemodynamic compromise. Ensure the serum potassium level is above 4 mmol/L

In non medical jargon, the diagnosis is often known as “ ringworm ”. It is sometimes accompanied by loss of hair, itching and pustules. 
 
 2.1.1Tinea Corporis (Body Ringworm) Annular, expanding lesions with central healing and distinct borders on the body or face. A fine scale may be present. 
  
 Treatment Drug of choice   <br> A: <br> <br> Compound benzoic acid (Whitfield’s ointment) applied two times a day for up to 4 weeks. Second choice    <br> A: <br> <br> Clotrimazole cream1% applies thinly two times a day, continue for 5 to 7 days after clearing of lesions        OR    <br> <b>C: <br></b> <br>Miconazole cream 2%, and apply thinly two times a day.  Continue for 5-7 days after clearing of lesions. 
  
 2.1.2 Tinea Capitis (Scalp Ringworm) In this case, the fungus has affected the hair follicle.  Topical treatment is not effective.  Treat with: <br>    B: <br> Griseofulvin (O) 500mg daily for 6 week, together with fatty meals    Children 15-20mg/kg once daily

    <div class="s-df">Drug reactions can be classified in many ways. One useful approach is to separate           predictable reactions occurring in normal patients from unpredictablereactions occurring in susceptible patients.
 
 
 Predictable adverse reactions <br> -  Overdosage (wrong dosage or defect in drug metabolism) <br> -  Side effects (sleepiness from antihistamines) <br> -  Indirect effects (antibiotics change normal flora) <br> -  Drug interactions (alter metabolism of drugs; most commonly the cytochromeP-450 system) 
  
 Unpredictable adverse reactions <br> -  Allergic reaction (drug allergy or hypersensitivity; immunologic reaction to drug; requires previous exposure or cross-reaction). <br> -  Pseudoallergic reaction (nonimmunologic activation of mast cells). <br> -  Idiosyncratic reaction (unexplained reaction, not related to mechanism of action, without known or suspected immunologic mechanism). _  Note: <br> 
  <br> -  Although we will concentrate on cutaneous drug reactions, remember that every organ system can be affected. 
  
 <br> -  Almost every drug can cause almost every type of reaction. Clinically, one must learn which reactions are most likely to produce certain findings.  <br> -  80% of allergic and pseudoallergic drug reactions are caused by β -lactam antibiotics, aspirin, NSAIDs, and sulfonamides 
  
 Types of Drug Reactions The most common types of drug reactions are macular and maculopapular exanthems along with urticaria and angioedema; Fixed drug eruption and erythema multiforme/toxic epidermal necrolysis  
  
 I. Exanthemous Reaction . Main differential diagnostic consideration is viral exanthem or on occasion acute exanthem such as guttae psoriasis or pityriasis rosea. 
  
 Drugs commonly responsible: <br> Ampicillin, amoxicillin, aminoglycosides, allopurinol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, co-trimoxazole, gold salts, penicillin, phenytoin, piroxicam 
  
  
 II. Fixed drug Eruption. It is a cutaneous drug reaction that recurs at exactly the same site with repeated exposure to the agent.Clinical features include typically red-brown patch or plaque; occasionally may be bullous. Most common sites are genitalia, palms, and soles, as well as mucosa. Lesions typically 5–10cm in diameter but can be larger; often multiple. It starts as edematous papule or plaque; later becomes darker. Frequently resolves with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. It is uncommon in children. _ Note: <br> When confronted with hyperpigmented macule on genitalia, always think of fixed drug eruption Management: <br> Avoidance of triggering agent; topical corticosteroids may speed resolution 
  
 III. Severe Skin Reactions a. Erythema multiforme Most erythema multiforme is caused by herpes simplex virus, especially if recurrent. The classical clinical findings are iris or target lesions, most often on the distal limbs. Lesions caused by mycoplasma or especially drugs are moreoften on the trunk and less like to have a target pattern. We prefer the term erythema multiforme – like for such lesions, which carry the risk of developing into severe skin reactions. 
  
  
  
 b. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) It is a combination of erythema multiforme with mucosal lesions as well as systemic signs and symptoms whereby more than 90% of the skin area is involved 
  
 Clinical features: <br> <br> -  Patients almost invariably have prodrome with fever, malaise, or arthralgias. <br> -  Abrupt development of erythema multiforme <br> -  Mucosal involvement  
  
 <br> -  Mouth
  
 (100%): <br> Erosions, hemorrhage and crusts on lips, and erosions in <br> -  Mouth covered by necrotic white pseudomembrane. <br> -  Eyes (70–90%): <br> Erosive conjunctivitis, can lead to scarring. <br> -  Genitalia (60–70%): <br> Painful erosions. <br> -  When mycoplasma is trigger, pulmonary involvement is possible (20%). 
  
 Management  <br> -  Short burst of systemic corticosteroids helpful in many cases but two problems: <br> <br> -  Exclude or treat underlying infection, which could beworsened by immunosuppression.. <br> -  Routine topical care: <br> disinfectant mouth washes, antibiotic or corticosteroid eye drops (after ophthalmologic consultation). 
  
 c. Toxic epidermal necrolysis It is a severe life-threatening disorder with generalized loss of epidermis and mucosa 
  
 Clinical features: <br> <br> -  Prodrome depends on underlying disease and triggering drug <br> -   Sudden onset of either diffuse maculae (erythema multiforme–like drug reaction) or diffuse erythema without maculae <br> -  Then prompt progression towards widespread erythema and peeling of skin; skin lies in sheets and   folds on the bedding.  <br> -  Extensive mucosal erosions.  <br> -  Possible loss of hair and nails, as well as extensive postinflammatory hypopigmentation. <br> -  Multiple systemic programs because of fluid and protein loss, difficulties in temperature regulation, fever, leukocytosis, and risk of secondary infections. 
  
 Treatment   Systemic corticosteroids, if employed, should be used early to attempt to abort the immunologic reaction. Later in the course, they probably increase risk of infection and slowhealing.  
  
<br> A: <br> <br> Prednisolone 80–120mg daily. 
  
 Note: <br> Ophthalmologic monitoring is essential, as risk of scarring and blindness is significant 
  
 d. Pruritic papula eruptions (PPE) This is a skin condition characterized by itchy popular eruptions on the extensor area of the upper and lower limbs which is associated with HIV infection. 
  
  
 Treatment

    <td>Albinism </td>
    <td>
    <div class="s-df">Definition Albinism is an inherited condition present at birth, characterized by a lack of pigment that normally gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of albinism exist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varying degrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may be accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin cancer later in life if not well prevented at elarly childhood. 
Diagnosis It's not always easy to diagnose the exact type of albinism a person has; there are two tests available that can identify only two types of the condition. Recently, a blood test has been developed that can identify carriers of the gene for some types of albinism; a similar test during amniocentesis can diagnose some types of albinism in an unborn child. A chorionic villus sampling test during the fifth week of pregnancy may also reveal some types of albinism. 
The specific type of albinism a person has can be determined by taking a good family history and examining the patient and several close relatives. 
The "hairbulb pigmentation test" is used to identify carriers by incubating a piece of the person's hair in a solution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the body uses to make melanin. If the hair turns dark, it means the hair is making melanin (a "positive" test); light hair means there is no melanin. This test is the source of the names of two types of albinism: <br> "typos" and "ty-neg." 
The tyrosinase test is more precise than the hairbulb pigmentation test. It measures the rate at which hair converts tyrosine into another chemical (DOPA), which is then made into pigment. The hair converts tyrosine with the help of a substance called "tyrosinase." In some types of albinism, tyrosinase is not active and hence melanin production breaks down. 
Prevention -Genetic counseling is very important to prevent further occurrences of the condition. 
-Mechanical preventions such as long slive shirt, bouze , skirt and trousers and wide briam hat to prevente skin cancers  
Adults and Children 
<br> <b>C: <br></b> <br> SPF 30+(Contains-Titanium Dioxide 9% , Zinc  Oxide 8%) 
Apply twice a day at 8am and 2pm Daily. 
 
Treatment There is no treatment that can replace the lack of melanin that causes the symptoms of albinism. For the eye problems that often accompany the lack of skin color, glasses which are tinted should be worn to ease pain from too much sunlight.  
There is no cure for involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and treatments for focusing problems (surgery or contact lenses) are not effective in all cases.
